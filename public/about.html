<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Kahan. I'm 21 yers old and I'm Turkish. I started studying in the computer engineering department in 2022. As a result of my efforts, I was accepted to important programmes such as Aspire and Yetgen and Denizbank DenizAsiri Internship. Due to my strong communication skills and friendly nature, I had the opportunity to work at Hilton and many hotels. I am someone who does not give up and loves to improve myself, and I like to discover new things instead of a stable life.</p>
